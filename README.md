In the rapidly evolving digital landscape network
security and efficiency are important especially with the increasingly widespread network anomalies that can cause severe
performance degradation. This study introduces a hybrid machine learning approach that combines Random Forest and Naive
Bayes algorithm to address anomaly detection challenges. Using
the ’UNSW-NB15 1’ dataset, data preprocessing is performed,
which includes removing missing values and standardizing attributes. The hybrid model uses random forest to select features
and identify key features which is then used by Na¨ıve Bayes
Classifier for effective anomaly detection This method not only
accurately predicts anomalies but also provides network weakness insights contributing to more secure network connection.
The dataset that has been been considered for the study, is
the ’UNSW-NB15 1’ dataset. The initial dataset consists of
49 columns and 7000001 rows.
